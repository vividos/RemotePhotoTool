            <h1>Zadig + libgphoto2</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
            RemotePhotoTool can use the libgphoto2 libraries to access even more camera models.
            libgphoto2 uses direct USB communication to talk to the cameras. For this, a special
            USB driver needs to be installed for the camera. Here's how to install and unstall
            the driver.
        </p>

        <h2>Using Zadig</h2>

        <p>
            The USB driver that is used by libgphoto2 is "WinUSB". The tool "Zadig" can configure
            which devices use the Windows-provided USB driver or the "WinUSB" driver. Note that
            while the driver is active, you can't use the device normally. The Zadig tool can be
            downloaded here: <a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/">Zadig</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/zadig-install.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            The tool shows all connected USB devices and their installed drivers. You may have to
            set the flag "List All Devices" in the options menu to show all devices. The combobox
            at the top currently shows a "Canon Digital Camera". The current driver is named
            "WUDFWpdMtp", which is a Windows driver. To select the proper driver for libgphoto2,
            select "WinUSB" using the up and down arrows, as shown in the screenshot. When
            ready, press the "Replace Driver" button. The action may take a several seconds.
        </p>

        <h2>Using RemotePhotoTool</h2>

        <p>
            RemotePhotoTool also offers a simplified dialog that also lists the connected devices.
            Open this dialog by clicking on the "Switch USB driver" on the camera connect dialog.
            The list refreshes every second. Select a device and click on the "Switch" button.
            After several seconds, the driver status of the device should switch to "gPhoto2
            compatible" and can be used in RemotePhotoTool.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>Uninstalling the USB driver</h2>

        <p>
            Unfortunately the Zadig tool doesn't provide a way to go back to the original Windows
            driver. Only with the original driver enables to show the camera's file system in
            Windows Explorer, or use other remote tools. Start the Device Manager by pressing the
            Windows key and start typing "device manager":
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/startmenu-device-manager.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            The Device Manager lists all connected USB devices. There you can right-click on the
            device and select "Uninstall".
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/device-manager-uninstall.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            In the next dialog, select "Delete the driver software for this device".
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/driver-delete.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            After this, re-connect the device so that Windows installs the original driver. For
