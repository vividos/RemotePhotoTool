# RemotePhotoTool

## About

RemotePhotoTool is a remote image capture application for Canon based cameras. It supports taking HDR and Panorama photos.

This is the open source project page. For non-developer related informations, head over to:

## Build

Instead of releasing new versions of the tool periodically, I switched to AppVeyor builds that are
run as soon as a new change is checked into the Git repository. The latest build and the build
artifacts can be found here:
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vividos/remotephototool
Here's the current build status:
