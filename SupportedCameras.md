# Supported cameras #

Note that most cameras may work, but due to the fact that I only own a Canon EOS 40D, Canon Powershot G9
and G2, not all cameras are tested. All tested cameras are marked  `tested and works`. If you want
to report a working camera, test the application with the steps outlined in [TestCases.md](TestCases.md)
and send me a message with the test results and camera infos (output from the Camera Info dialog).
